        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our project! EcoSense was a 24 hour hackathon project built by Rishi Golla, Amber Hasan, Dana Ibrahim and Caden Cochran.  EcoSense is a project focused on promoting energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings. It helps organizations and individuals monitor their energy usage and identify areas where they can reduce waste. By analyzing energy consumption data, EcoSense highlights patterns and suggests ways to optimize energy use, ultimately leading to cost savings and a reduced environmental impact. The goal is to empower users with insights to make smarter, greener choices that contribute to a more sustainable future.
